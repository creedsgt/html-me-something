    <h1>My Alaskan Experience</h1>
    <div>
      <p class="New">My name is Clayton Reed. I am 30 years old and father of 2 boys. I served in the U. S. Army for over 6 years.
      My favorite place I was stationed was Ft. Wainwright outside of Fairbanks Alaska. I was stationed there for 3 years from
    2007 to 2010.</p>

    <p class="New">There are many different things to do in Fairbanks and it all depends on what you would like to do. With most of the year being
      a cold winter or what the locals call break-up season not many people like to do activities in the cold weather.</p>

<h2>Things to do</h2>
<h3>Nenana Ice Classic</h3>
<p>There are many things<a href="http://www.alaska.org/destination/fairbanks/attractions"> to do while visiting Fairbanks.</a> But we will go over
  many differnet sites and sounds so to speak that you would not normally see on a travel site. One very intersting piece of useless
information, Gambiling is illegal in the state of Alaska. In a small town called Nenana they have a larg tripod that in winter they put it on
the river. The tripod has a long wire attatched to one end, and the other is attached to a clock tower on the river shore. The point of
it all during the season called break-up right after winter, is for people to buy tickets with the purpose of guessing the exact
month, day, hour, minute that the tripod will fall through the ice. When it does fall through the wire will pull the bell on the clock
tower letting the whole town know that the tripod has fallen through the ice and summer will be soon.</p>

<h3>Midnight Sun Game</h3>
<p>Another interesting thing to do is experience the Midnight Sun Game. During the Summer Soltace celebration on the longest day of the year
  they have an American Pastime but with an Alaskan twist. The Midnight Sun game is a Baseball game that is started at 10 p.m. and is played
  throughout without turning on the stadium lights. The tradition goes back to 1906, however the only records that can be found are from the
  current team the Alaska Goldpanners. The Goldpanners are the home team and have accrued a record of 41 wins and 11 losses. It was rumored
  that teams from all around the country apply for the chance to play in the game, and the waiting list is over 50 years!</p>
